// state.db is one shared path per harness — ~/.local/share/llm-bridge-codex/state.db
// — and every bridge process of this kind opens it. On a fresh install several
// of them reach the file at once and each tries to convert it to WAL.
//
// Holding a write transaction on the fresh file makes that race deterministic
// rather than roughly-half-the-time. Against a conversion that cannot retry this
// fails on every run, and it fails instantly: the 0s is the finding, because a
// connection that had honoured its own 5s busy_timeout would have outlasted a
// 150ms lock. SQLite declines to run the busy handler for the lock upgrade the
// conversion needs, so busy_timeout has nothing to give and the wait has to be

// busy_timeout and foreign_keys in the DSN, journal_mode as the one statement
// switchJournalMode runs — and each route fails quietly in its own way.
// modernc's driver drops a DSN key it does not recognise instead of rejecting
// it, so a mattn-style ?_busy_timeout=5000 leaves the setting at its default and
// says nothing; and a lost journal_mode race can report the mode it stayed on
// rather than an error.
//
// foreign_keys is the one with teeth: rollouts references sessions, and SQLite
// enforces that only while the pragma is on.
