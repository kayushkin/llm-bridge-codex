"""Sabotage-score the rune-boundary truncation tests.

A suite that passes tells you nothing on its own. This breaks the fix in six
ways and checks that the tests notice five of them and, just as importantly, do
NOT notice the sixth. A scorer with no known-negative control reports CAUGHT for
everything and looks perfect while measuring nothing.

Three things this harness is careful about, all learned the expensive way by
earlier passes of this sweep:

  * Mutations are written as drifted comparisons or substitutions that keep every
    identifier live. Deleting the walk-back orphans the `utf8` import, and
    `go test` runs vet, so the case would report a compile error instead of a
    score -- and a compile error hides whether any test would have caught the
    behaviour.

  * CAUGHT is split into assertion-fired and guard-fired. A test can go red
    because its own fixture blew up (t.Fatalf on a setup step) rather than
    because it detected the defect. That is not coverage, and counting it as
    coverage inflates the score.

  * classify() is exercised against every verdict it can return, including the
    two panic verdicts no row in this table produces. A table cannot score its
    own scorer: the forty-eighth pass shipped a scorer whose panic branch was
    unreachable and read 5/5 with it dead, because nothing it mutated panicked.

# press by hand while watching, and the ones it misses are the ones an unattended
# run actually receives. Measured by kill on this scorer before these handlers
# existed: SIGTERM and SIGHUP each left the mutated file behind.
